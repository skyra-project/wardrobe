## Wardrobe Concept Guidelines

There are a number of guidelines considered when reviewing Pull Requests to be merged. _This is by no means an exhaustive list, but here are some things to consider before/while submitting your ideas._

-   Everything in Wardrobe should be generally useful for the majority of users. Don't let that stop you if you've got a good concept though, as your idea still might be a great addition.
-   Scripts that are to be ran should be added to [scripts] directory and should be in the `.mjs` file format.
